Mobile Price Prediction
This project focuses on predicting the price range of mobile phones based on various features and specifications. The goal is to develop a predictive model that accurately classifies mobile phones into different price categories.

Project Overview
The project utilizes machine learning techniques to analyze a dataset of mobile phone features and predict their corresponding price ranges. The analysis aims to answer questions such as:

What are the key features that influence the pricing of mobile phones?
How accurately can we predict the price range based on these features?
Can we identify important factors that differentiate low-cost, mid-range, and high-end mobile devices?
Data Collection and Analysis
The dataset used in this project consists of mobile phone specifications, including features like battery capacity, RAM, camera quality, etc., along with their corresponding price ranges. The dataset is preprocessed and analyzed using machine learning algorithms and techniques.

Key steps in the analysis process:

Data preprocessing: Cleaning the dataset, handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
Exploratory data analysis: Visualizing the relationships between features and price range, identifying correlations, and extracting insights.
Feature selection: Identifying the most important features that contribute to the price prediction task.
Model training and evaluation: Implementing machine learning algorithms (such as decision trees, random forests, or neural networks) to train predictive models and evaluating their performance.
Model optimization: Fine-tuning the models by adjusting hyperparameters, applying feature engineering techniques, or employing ensemble methods to improve prediction accuracy.
Model deployment: Once a satisfactory model is achieved, it can be deployed for making predictions on new, unseen mobile phone data.
Results and Evaluation
The predictive model developed in this project demonstrates good accuracy in predicting the price range of mobile phones. Key findings include:

Features such as RAM, battery capacity, and camera quality have significant influence on mobile phone prices.
The trained model achieves an accuracy of 94.4%, accurately classifying mobile phones into different price categories.
Cross-validation and performance metrics (e.g., precision, recall, and F1-score) provide insights into the model's effectiveness.
The project further explores potential applications for the predictive model, such as assisting customers in making informed purchasing decisions or supporting businesses in pricing strategies.
